# Typography

We use a set of typefaces...

## Headings

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Heading1} />
<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Heading2} />
<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Heading3} />

## Heading groups

Although visually identical, there are two types of header groups based on whether the group should be read as a single sentence or not.

In the first example, the heading will be read by screen readers as `The story of Alice Hawkins.`

<Canvas of={HeadingGroupStories.HeadingGroup} />

In the second example, the heading will be read as two separate sentences; `Record revealed. The Monteagle Letter.`

<Canvas of={HeadingGroupStories.HeadingGroupSeparated} />

## General typography

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Paragraph} />
<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Blockquote} />
<Canvas of={ListStories.UnorderedList} />
<Canvas of={ListStories.UnorderedListPlain} />
<Canvas of={ListStories.OrderedList} />
<Canvas of={ListStories.OrderedListPlain} />
